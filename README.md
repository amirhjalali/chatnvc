# <CHATNVC>

## Description

Chat NVC is a POC for a chatbot that can proactively guide a subscriber to utilizing principles of NVC (NonViolent Communication) in their daily lives.

- Chatbots and AI agents have a great potential in helping us navigate the day to days of our lives. The goal here is to see if we can make the interaction a bit more proactive.
- This project was designed as a proof of concept for directing and navigating LLM chatbots to specific and personalized behaviors.
- Daily reminders of the lessons of NVC and further down the line customizing these is the best approach to learning this philosophy
